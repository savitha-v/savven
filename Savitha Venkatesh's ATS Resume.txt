Experience 
1. Software Engineer, Cognizant, Jun 2022 – Aug 2023 
• Underwent extensive hands-on training for eleven weeks mastering project 
management and software development concepts and technologies to be well
equipped to meet client needs for their projects and tasks   
• Team Project – Managed a team of five new graduates to design, develop, and launch a 
full-stack e-commerce shopping website allowing users to shop for handmade items 
using Spring Boot, Spring Tool Suite, MySQL, Angular, JavaScript, and HTML. Increased 
team efficiency by 20% through effective task allocation and utilization of GitHub Task 
Board for project management, while also putting together a presentation for the senior 
software engineers and executives in the ADM branch and scoring an average rating of 
4.8 out of 5 

2. Data Engineering Intern, VMware, May 2021 – Aug 2021 
• Developed a task tracker tool to track all data engineer and analyst jobs daily by 
reporting details of each job through AWS Redshift and S3, using JIRA to schedule and 
plan tasks for this project, and employing Python for the backend and automation and 
SQL queries for creating the output leading to a 25% reduction in time spent on tracking 
and reporting daily data engineer and analyst jobs 
• Conducted a gap analysis on data maintained by two different pipelines (one from EDW 
and one from EUC Data Engineering) and edited my team’s SQL run job using Git to 
extract data from the EDW pipeline, thus reducing data pipeline maintenance efforts by 
30% and creating a streamlined and more efficient data processing workflow 

3. Cloud Team Student Engineer, University of Texas at Dallas, Sep 2020 – May 2021 & Aug 2021 – Feb 2022 
• Planned and created documentation to carry out specific tasks and functions in Amazon 
Web Services (AWS) using Jira and Confluence and created templates on AWS 
CloudFormation to provide necessary resources for the development of an application 
or solution 
• Projects: AppStream 2.0 is a computing resource developed in response to 
COVID-19 and remote student learning to allow students to stream applications 
and access software instead of downloading them on their personal devices 
• Tested Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification 
System (AMDIS) which is one of many applications run in AppStream 
2.0, and developed workflow and troubleshooting guide on Confluence 
for students and professors using AMDIS, thus reducing support 
requests by 15% and increasing student adoption of the platform by 
40% 

Portfolio Projects 
1. Down By The Fishin’ Hole, UWG – Program Construction II, Feb 2024 
• Engineered a Java-based simulation game (https://github.com/savitha-v/Down-By-The
Fishin-Hole), showcasing advanced object-oriented programming techniques. The game 
architecture leverages encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism with its classes 
and subclasses. Utilized interfaces and abstract classes to establish a flexible and 
extensible design, allowing different fish behaviors and fishing hole characteristics. 
Implemented exception handling to manage runtime errors, ensuring robust game 
functionality. The game's design demonstrates adeptness in utilizing Java's collection 
framework, employing arrays to manage game elements dynamically. Developed a user-friendly
textual interface with interactive menus, enabling players to navigate the game 
world, simulating real-world fishing experiences. This project underscores my proficiency 
in Java's core features, design patterns, and standard libraries, illustrating my capability 
to construct intricate, well-organized software solutions. 

2. Personal Training Booking Platform, UWG – Web Technologies I, Dec 2023 
• Developed a responsive website (https://savitha-v.github.io/ptconnect/) for purchasing 
personal training sessions as part of my final exam project in a web development course. 
Implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the site demonstrates my 
proficiency in front-end technologies and showcases an intuitive user interface for a 
seamless purchasing experience. 

3. Career Portfolio, UWG – Web Technologies I, Oct 2023 
• Developed a professional portfolio website (https://savitha-v.github.io/savven/) for my 
midterm exam project in a web development course. Implemented using HTML and CSS 
and showcasing my technical skills and projects, the site features a clean design, easy 
navigation, and highlights my software engineering expertise, serving as a central hub 
for potential employers to explore my work and capabilities.
