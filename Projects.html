          <h2>ELemental Clash Card Game</h2>
          <h3>UWG - Project I</h3>
          <p>Developed a strategic card game <a href="https://github.com/savitha-v/Elemental-Clash-Card-Game/"><span class="bold">(https://github.com/savitha-v/Elemental-Clash-Card-Game/)</span></a> 
            utilizing <span class="bold">core Java skills</span> to create a robust and scalable application. 
            Implemented the <span class="bold>Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern</span> to separate the UI from the game logic, ensuring maintainability and flexibility. 
            Designed and managed game state using <span class="bold">Java serialization/deserialization</span> for saving and loading game progress. 
            Conducted thorough testing with <span class="bold">JUnit</span> to ensure reliability and functionality. 
            Employed principles of <span class="bold">low coupling and high cohesion</span> to enhance code quality and readability. 
            Utilized the <span class="bold">Observer pattern</span> to synchronize game state with the user interface, providing a responsive and interactive gaming experience.</p>

          <h2>Personal Training Booking Platform</h2>
          <h3>UWG - Web Technologies I</h3>
          <p>Developed a responsive website <a href="https://savitha-v.github.io/ptconnect/"><span
                class="bold">(https://savitha-v.github.io/ptconnect/)</span></a> for
            purchasing personal training sessions as part of my final exam project in a web
            development course. Implemented using <span class="bold">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap,</span> the
            site demonstrates my proficiency in front-end technologies and showcases an intuitive
            user interface for a seamless purchasing experience.

          <h3>UWG - Web Technologies I</h3>
          <p>Developed a professional portfolio website <a href="https://savitha-v.github.io/savven/"><span
                class="bold">(https://savitha-v.github.io/savven/)</span></a> for
            my midterm exam project in a web development course. Implemented using <span class="bold">HTML and
              CSS</span> and showcasing my technical skills and projects, the site features a clean design,
            easy navigation, and highlights my software engineering expertise, serving as a central
            hub for potential employers to explore my work and capabilities.

          <h2>Pima Indians Diabetes Study</h2>
          <h3>Independent Project</h3>
          <p>Using <span class="bold">Python, created predictive supervised machine learning models based on regression and classification 
            methods</span> mirroring the accuracy of the Pima Indians Diabetes Study, which was a study conducted on Pima Indian 
            women predicting whether they could potentially be diabetic or at risk based on fasting vital signs and biodata. 
            Models allowed user to input their vital signs and understand if they were at risk for diabetes.

          <h2>Energy Consumption</h2>
          <h3>Independent Project</h3>
          <p>Using <span class="bold">RStudio</span>, visualized energy consumption data by creating <span class="bold">bar graphs</span> for each country/regionâ€™s energy type and 
            usage and for amount consumed by top five countries/regions, and a <span class="bold">correlation map</span> between energy types used.
            Visualizations allowed for understanding on types of energy used by countries, and if consumption of one energy type
            was correlated to another: Ethanol and biodiesel usage do not correlate with kinetic energy usage. US consumes the 
            most energy in 10 out of 17 energy types, followed by China. Results show that population has a strong correlation to 
            energy consumption.

          <h2>Boston Crime Analysis</h2>
          <h3>UTD - Data Analysis for Statisticians & Actuaries</h3>
          <p>Team project - <span class="bold">Analyze and visualized</span> various types of crimes and patterns in Boston over a 3-year period using
            <span class="bold">RStudio</span> by creating a <span class="bold">line graph</span> representing crime rate categorized by crime type, month, and year, and a <span class="bold">bubble
            plot</span> showing occurrence numbers of each crime grouped by district and year.
            Results showed that districts B2, B3, C11, and D4 had most crimes and highest crime rate was in December and January.

          <h2>Down By The Fishin' Hole</h2>
          <h3>UWG - Program Construction II</h3>
          <p>Engineered a <span class="bold">Java-based</span> simulation game <a
              href="https://github.com/savitha-v/Down-By-The-Fishin-Hole"><span
                class="bold">(https://github.com/savitha-v/Down-By-The-Fishin-Hole)</span></a>, showcasing advanced
            <span class="bold">object-oriented programming</span> techniques. The game architecture leverages <span
              class="bold">encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism</span> with its classes and subclasses.
            Utilized <span class="bold">interfaces and abstract classes</span> to establish a flexible and extensible
            design, allowing different fish behaviors and fishing hole characteristics. Implemented <span
              class="bold">exception handling</span> to manage runtime errors, ensuring robust game functionality. The
            game's design demonstrates adeptness in utilizing <span class="bold">Java's collection framework,
              employing arrays</span> to manage game elements dynamically. Developed a <span class="bold">user-friendly
              textual interface</span> with interactive menus, enabling players to navigate
            the game world, simulating real-world fishing experiences. This project underscores my proficiency in
            <span class="bold">Java's core features, design patterns, and standard libraries</span>, illustrating my
            capability to construct intricate, well-organized software solutions.
